;;; Commentary:

;; Chezmoi is a dotfile management system that uses a source-target state
;; architecture.  This package provides convenience functions for maintaining
;; synchronization between the source and target states when making changes to
;; your dotfiles through Emacs.  It provides alternatives to `find-file' and
;; `save-buffer' for source state files which maintain synchronization to the
;; target state.  It also provides diff/ediff tools for resolving when dotfiles
;; get out of sync.  Dired and magit integration is also provided.
